fake-plastic-pycrypto
=====================

Pretends to be PyCrypto just enough to make the non-terminal bits of Divmod Mantissa work.

This is a horrible, horrible hack brought on by a hot afternoon, too much
driving around and @mithrandi complaining that he can't use pypy because
Mantissa needs PyCrypto in places it shouldn't.
